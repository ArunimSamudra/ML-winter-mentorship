# Machine Learning Mentorship

This is the repository that contains all the material/code required to get started with the mentorship programme. 


## Prerequisites:-

1. Language: We'll be using Python3 throughout this course. So familiarise yourself with the language. Also learn to install packages using pip.

2. Libraries:

    a. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for matrix computations.
    
    b. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data analysis.

4. Tools:

    a. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
    
    b. git: You'll be using GitHub for all your code/assignment submission, so learn the basics of git: pull, push, add, commit.

 
## Course Structure
The whole mentorship program is of 4 weeks. By the end of the program mentee would have learned Python and Machine learning
alongwith the implementation of some amazing projects.
